# Workflow: Creating a New Component

Follow this workflow when you need to build a new React component for OpsLens. It chains the relevant rules and skills together so you end up with something that fits the codebase.

## Before You Touch Any File

**Step 1. Check whether the component already exists.**

Search `components/` for anything with a similar name or purpose — especially before building a new severity, confidence, or evidence indicator. If a similar component exists, the right move is almost always to extend it (add a variant, add a prop) rather than create a new one. Two slightly different badge components for the same concept is the start of a trust-model inconsistency, not just a code-quality one.

**Step 2. Decide where it goes.**

- Primitive (Button, Input, Card, SeverityBadge, ConfidenceTag) → `components/ui/`
- Issue Detail-specific (EvidencePanel, CausalChain, StatusStepper) → `components/issues/`
- Morning Brief / Health Score-specific (HealthScoreDisplay, RiskSnapshotCard) → `components/overview/`
- Department views (FinanceMetricCard, InventoryRiskList) → `components/departments/`
- Dashboard-wide chrome (NavSidebar, OrgSwitcher) → `components/dashboard/`
- Composite used in multiple domains (EmptyState, PageHeader) → `components/shared/`
- Used exactly once in a page and complex → `app/.../_components/` alongside that page

**Step 3. Load the right context.**

Open and read these files in order:

1. `.agents/rules/design-system.md` — the tokens, spacing, typography, and component patterns, including the severity/confidence color mapping.
2. `.agents/rules/code-style.md` — naming, file organization, TypeScript conventions.
3. `.agents/skills/component-builder/SKILL.md` — the component template, variant patterns, and the trust-model-aware component rules.

Do not skip these. They are short and they are the difference between a component that fits and one that quietly breaks the trust model.

## Build It

**Step 4. Create the file.**

Use the template from `.agents/skills/component-builder/SKILL.md`:

```tsx
import { cn } from '@/lib/cn';

type ComponentNameProps = {
  // required props first
  // optional props after
  className?: string;
};

export function ComponentName({ /* ... */, className }: ComponentNameProps) {
  return (
    <div className={cn('base-classes-here', className)}>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Step 5. Decide server vs. client.**

Default to a server component. Add `"use client"` only if the component actually needs state, effects, browser APIs, or real event handlers — the AI Assistant's streaming chat view is the clearest example that genuinely needs it. If you're unsure, start without `"use client"` and let TypeScript tell you if you need it.

**Step 6. Style with design tokens.**

Tailwind classes, no inline styles, no custom CSS. Use the CSS custom properties from `design-system.md` (`bg-[--color-brand-solid]`, `text-[--color-text-primary]`, the severity/confidence token pairs). If you find yourself reaching for an arbitrary value, pause and check whether there's a token for it. There almost always is.

**Step 7. Handle variants with `cva` if needed.**

See the pattern in `.agents/skills/component-builder/SKILL.md`. Do not stack conditional class strings.

**Step 8. If the component displays AI-generated content, apply the trust-model rules.**

- Compose `SeverityBadge` / `ConfidenceTag` / `EvidencePanel` / `CausalChain` / `StatusStepper` rather than hand-rolling a colored indicator.
- Evidence is visible in the default state — never hidden behind a hover or a secondary click.
- Low-confidence text content is never set in a heavier weight than higher-confidence content in the same view.

**Step 9. Wire accessibility.**

- Interactive elements get a visible focus state.
- Icon-only buttons get `aria-label`.
- Severity/confidence/status badges get an `aria-label` describing the state in words, since they communicate primarily through color.
- Form inputs get associated labels.
- Images get `alt` text.

## Check Your Work

**Step 10. Write a test if the component has anything to break.**

Per `code-style.md`'s Testing section: if the component has state, conditional rendering, a variant/token lookup (`SeverityBadge` mapping a severity to a token, `ConfidenceTag` picking a tint), or any other logic, write a colocated `*.test.tsx` with React Testing Library covering what a user can do and what renders under which prop or state — not implementation details. A purely presentational component with no logic to break (a static layout wrapper, an icon-only decorative element) can skip this; when in doubt, write the test.

**Step 11. Manually verify.**

If it's a primitive, render every variant, size, and state somewhere you can see them all at once during development — a scratch page, or an existing screen that already exercises several variants. (There's no dedicated preview route or Storybook-style setup in this codebase yet — don't assume one exists.) Tab into it to check the focus state. Hover over it. If it renders AI content, verify the evidence is visible without any extra interaction.

If it's a domain component, view it in the page that uses it. Resize to check smaller viewports. Check keyboard navigation.

This manual pass is a sanity check on top of Step 10's test, not a substitute for it.

**Step 12. Cross-check against the rules.**

- [ ] Named export, not default.
- [ ] `className` prop accepted and merged with `cn()`.
- [ ] No hardcoded colors or pixel values.
- [ ] No `any` types.
- [ ] No `"use client"` unless actually needed.
- [ ] Focus state visible.
- [ ] AI-generated content (if any) shows its evidence by default, not on hover.
- [ ] Low-confidence content is not set in a heavier weight than higher-confidence content.
- [ ] No `console.log` left behind.
- [ ] A test exists if the component has any logic; skipped deliberately, not by omission, if it doesn't.

**Step 13. Commit.**

Descriptive commit message. If the component is non-trivial, mention the intended use case in the message body so future you or future agents know why it exists.

## When Things Go Wrong

If you're stuck on something that doesn't fit the design system — a new color, a new badge shape, a layout the tokens don't cover — do not invent new tokens or patterns. Ask the developer. The whole point of a design system (and especially of the severity/confidence color mapping specifically) is that it doesn't grow unchecked, because unchecked growth here is how the trust model gets diluted one component at a time.
